Hi,

this a IEEE 802.11 a/g/p transceiver for GNU Radio v3.7. and the USRP N210. I tested it with the XCVR2450 and CBX daughterboards.

DEPENDENCIES
============
IT++ (Version: 4.2-4)
GNU Radio (v3.7 with UHD support)
If you want to run the receive demo (the one that plots the subcarrier constellations), please assert that you have python-opengl installed. The nongl version of the plot does not work for me.


INSTALLATION
============
sudo apt-get install libitpp-dev
git clone git://github.com/bastibl/gr-ieee802-11.git
cd gr-ieee802-11
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

The physical layer is encapsulated in a hierarchical block. To install it, open examples/ofdm_phy_hier.grc in GRC and click build.


USAGE
=====
In the examples folder are several flow graphs. For the more complex ones, there are start scripts in the apps folder.
